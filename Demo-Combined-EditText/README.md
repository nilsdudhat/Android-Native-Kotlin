This project will create a simple Android application that utilizes two coupled EditText fields. 

[Here's a breakdown of the functionalities:]

## App Functionality:

The application will have a user interface (UI) with two EditText fields.
Users can enter text in each EditText field.
When the text is entered in one field, it will be automatically mirrored and displayed in the other EditText field.

## Possible Enhancements:

You can implement additional functionalities based on the entered text, such as:
Password confirmation (ensure both fields match for password entry)
Username validation (check for username availability)
Data synchronization (keep both fields updated with the same information)

## Learning Objectives - This project will help you understand:

Using EditText widgets for user input
Event handling for text changes
Updating UI elements dynamically

## Project Setup:

Create a new Android Studio project and choose an appropriate name.
Design the UI layout in activity_main.xml using two EditText fields.
Implement the logic in the corresponding activity class (e.g., MainActivity.java) to:
Get references to the EditText fields
Set a listener for text changes in one EditText field
Update the other EditText field with the new text whenever a change occurs
